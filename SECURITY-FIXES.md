# Critical Security Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (Patched in this commit):

### 1. SSH Access Restriction
- **Before**: SSH (port 22) allowed from 0.0.0.0/0 (entire internet) 
- **After**: SSH restricted to private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8)
- **File**: `security_group.tf`
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized SSH access attempts from public internet

### 2. Password Authentication Disabled  
- **Before**: SSH password authentication enabled via userdata script
- **After**: Password authentication disabled, key-based auth only
- **File**: `userdata.sh`
- **Impact**: Eliminates brute force password attack vector

### 3. Hardcoded Credentials Removed
- **Before**: Provider had empty access_key/secret_key fields (credential structure)
- **After**: Removed credential fields, use AWS CLI profiles/IAM roles
- **File**: `provider.tf` 
- **Impact**: Prevents accidental credential exposure

### 4. IMDSv2 Enforced
- **Before**: Default EC2 metadata configuration (IMDSv1)
- **After**: Force IMDSv2 with hop limit 1
- **File**: `ec2.tf`
- **Impact**: Prevents SSRF attacks on instance metadata

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue (Architecture Limitation):

### 5. Public Subnet Deployment
- **Current**: All instances deployed in public subnets with direct internet access
- **Risk**: Instances directly accessible from internet (mitigated by security groups)
- **Solution**: Requires architecture change to private subnets + NAT Gateway
- **Recommendation**: Use the multi-workspace architecture instead of this legacy repo

## üéÆ Gaming-Specific Security Notes:

The SSH restriction to 10.0.0.0/8 provides temporary security while maintaining some accessibility for gaming use case. For production gaming setup:

1. **Implement VPN solution** (most secure)
2. **Use dynamic IP registration API** (practical)  
3. **Use Systems Manager Session Manager** (no SSH needed)
4. **Migrate to multi-workspace architecture** (better separation of concerns)

## Public Repository Safety:

These fixes make the public repository safer by removing the most critical attack vectors:
- No open SSH to internet
- No password-based authentication
- No credential structure that could be accidentally populated  
- Enhanced metadata security

**Next Steps**: Consider migrating to the multi-workspace architecture for production gaming infrastructure.
